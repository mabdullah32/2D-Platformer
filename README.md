### Project Description

Our project will be a metroidvania, with some roguelike aspects.

Plays similarly to hit game "20 Minutes Till Dawn," either top-down or underwater with low gravity and lots of drag, with enemies surrounding the player. However, enemies will be fewer but stronger and firing multiple projectiles for the player to dodge.

Point and click to shoot, WASD to mave, etc etc.

Likely a leveling system that scales the player's damage, hp, unlocks abilities(?)

Possibly a resource management system to use abilities...


### Skill Usage, in no particular order

Primitive Variables and Types - floats: movement (calculating gravity and drag), health and damage, etc. integers: size of platforms, size of the game, health bar display

Boolean Values - test for collisions with enemies and ground

setup and draw - setup: create the background and space. draw: update player position, enemy position, coins collected, etc. with each iteration

Readable Code - comments

Debugging Practices - using println() within functions to tell if they're working

Conditional Statements - velocity change calculations, collision processing, and many more

Loops - in attacks to check if any enemies are inside of a player attack

ArrayLists: keep track of enemies, spawners, waves

Objects and Classes: Enemy, Player, Spawner, Wave, Sprite, Collisions/hitboxes, attack


### Libraries (optional)
Iff you plan to use any auxiliary libraries, for each library... 
* Provide a clickable link.
* Explain necessity/applicability.
* Fill out this form: <https://forms.gle/TMH9CYeS8QE3kTq56>
* *Nota bene: Auxiliary library use subject to instructor approval. Have a backup plan, should library usage request be denied.*
* As soon as possible, and time-permitting, build a proof-of-principle prototype to demonstrate to yourself and team that you can utilize this library.
