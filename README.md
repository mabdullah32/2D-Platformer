### Project Description
Provide a high-level description of your project. Include explanatory links if they add value. Maximize signal:noise ratio.

Our project will be a metroidvania, with some roguelike aspects.
Plays similarly to hit game "20 Minutes Till Dawn," top-down (may experiment with the top-down aspect) with enemies surrounding the player. However, enemies will be fewer but stronger and firing multiple projectiles for the player to dodge.
Point and click to shoot, WASD to mave, etc etc.
Likely a leveling system that scales the player's damage, hp, unlocks abilities(?)
Possibly a resource management system to use abilities...

### Skill Usage
Explain which skills from this term you will showcase in this project, and ***how*** they will be used.

Classes: Enemy, player, projectile, boss
